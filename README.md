# Streamer.bot-AutoWelcome
Code for Streamer.bot Auto Welcome Messages and AutoShoutout

To Import Code to streamer.bot, just right click on the Actions List, under the Actions tab and click Import. Download the file then just click and drag the file from a file explorer window right into the import string area. A bunch of what looks like random text will show up and then other information will show up. Then just click Import.

Download both these files and import the first one into streamer.bot then link the "Read random Line" Sub-Action in the WelcomeMessage Action list with the WelcomeMessage.txt. There Are Comments in the import with more setup instructions. Under the settings tab in streamer.bot, goto the "Events" tab and add the welcome message action to "First Words".
